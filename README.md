## About the Project

This project is based on The [Odin Project: Authentication](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication). I built an exclusive clubhouse where the members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

I created User and Post model, controllers, dabatase and views with mainly three useful gems such as devise gem, devise-bootstrap-views gem and gravatar_image_tag gem. Plus, I'm using Bootstrap to organize layouts and all other views.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
